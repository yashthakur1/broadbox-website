      <h2>WE MAY LINK TO OTHER SITES OR HAVE THIRD PARTY SERVICES ON OUR SITE WE DON’T CONTROL.</h2>
      <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This includes social media and OTT platforms. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of these websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites and insurance carriers carefully. We are not responsible for these third party practices. Our site and apps may also link to and/or serve third party ads or other content that contains their own cookies or tracking technologies.</p>
      <h2>WE USE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES FOR MANY REASONS.</h2>
      <p>To understand the activities and behaviors of our consumers and website visitors.  Information you submit or post. For example, we collect the information you post in a public space on our website. We also collect information if you respond to a survey. To recognize new visitors to our websites and apps.  To recognize past customers.  To serve you with customized or interest-based advertising. These ads may appear on our website or others you visit So we can better understand our audience, our customers, our website visitors, and their respective interests.</p>
      <h2>WE ENGAGE IN INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING.</h2>
      <p>We may serve interest-based advertising using personal and other information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms. This might include apps. These ads are served on websites or apps. They might also be served in emails. Interest-based or “online behavioral advertising” includes ads that are served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return. They also include ads we think are relevant to you based on your shopping habits or online activities.</p>
      <h2>HOW DO WE GATHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING?</h2>
      <p>To decide what is relevant to you, we might look at your purchases, collect certain mobile unique operating system IDs or browsing behaviours. We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others. This information is gathered using the tracking tools described above. We work with third parties who help gather this information. These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect. That might include past purchases made oﬄine or online. Or, it might include online usage information</p>
      <h2>HOW TO CONTROL TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES.</h2>
      <p>You can control certain tracking tools. Many browsers give you the ability to delete or reject cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. You can configure your browser to reject browser cookies. Why? Because flash cookies do not reside in your browser, and thus your browser settings will not affect them. Not all of the tracking described here will stop if cookies are deleted or blocked. You can also control certain tracking tools on your mobile devices. These opportunities are subject to the offerings made available by the third-party operating system providers and subject to their privacy policies, and not any offerings by or the privacy policy of BroadBox. NOTE: If you configure your computer to block cookies, you may not be able to access certain functionality on our site or the toolbar. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking activities we have described here will stop.
